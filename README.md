Assignment Introduction to Digital Humanities

The LIMO database of ancient books contains information about printed publications present at the Library of Leuven which can be dated before 1840. 
Our specific dataset contains the metadata from ancient Belgian books dating from 1601 to 1625. 
The metadata is organized into two main categories. First, there is the bibliographical information of the books, for example their (sub)title, author(s), publisher(s), seller(s), printer(s) and so on. 
Second, there is the holding information of the books, including their provenance, acquisition, library and physical location.  

Assignment 1 General instructions:
The assignment consists in processing different datasets shared by researchers/library staff of the KU Leuven. The goal of this assignment is that the students
1. Familiarize themselves with OpenRefine and, in particular, its “reconciliation function”
2. Establish an efficient workflow
3. Manipulate regular expressions
The goal of the resulting dataset won’t be directly evaluated, however it will be a direct consequence of the previous points.
